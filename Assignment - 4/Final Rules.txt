Best Rules
All the rules generated must comply to the fact that the client has subscribed a term deposit or not.

24. marital=married 2797 ==> y=no 2520    <conf:(0.9)> lift:(1.02) lev:(0.01) [45] conv:(1.16)
This is a very important rule with a lift of 1.02, signifying that the married people mostly do not subscribe for a term deposit. 
There are multiple rules also vindicating this phenomena. 

25. marital=married default=no 2761 ==> y=no 2487    <conf:(0.9)> lift:(1.02) lev:(0.01) [44] conv:(1.16)
This is also a very similar rule yet it also strongly says that the married people do not have credit in default and thus also do not subscribe to a term deposit.
 
31. marital=married default=no loan=no 2320 ==> y=no 2069    <conf:(0.89)> lift:(1.01) lev:(0) [16] conv:(1.06)
Overall we can conclude from this assumptions of rules which have very high confidence and high lift that married people tend to take very low risks
and do not tend to divulge into loans and keep it balanced.

28. education=secondary default=no 2260 ==> y=no 2021    <conf:(0.89)> lift:(1.01) lev:(0) [21] conv:(1.09)
34. education=secondary default=no loan=no 1858 ==> y=no 1643    <conf:(0.88)> lift:(1) lev:(-0) [0] conv:(0.99)
People with good educational background rarely take loan as these rules imply that they are self sufficient. The confidence of these rules are high.
Along with the lift, which signify that they are positively correlated. 

9. job=management 969 ==> education=tertiary 787    conf:(0.81) < lift:(2.72)> lev:(0.11) [497] conv:(3.71)
1. job=management default=no 955 ==> education=tertiary loan=no 680    conf:(0.71) < lift:(2.74)> lev:(0.1) [431] conv:(2.56)
People with management jobs are with the highest education and thus are more than self sufficient and do not require any loan from the bank. 
These rules have very high confidence and very high lift, signifying positive correlation between them. 

age=47_max default=no 1456 ==> marital=married loan=no y=no 817    conf:(0.56) < lift:(1.21)> lev:(0.03) [143] conv:(1.22)
age=47_max 1481 ==> marital=married default=no loan=no y=no 817    conf:(0.55) < lift:(1.21)> lev:(0.03) [139] conv:(1.21)
These rules signify that people falling in the age group of 47-max are mostly married people with low risk. 
They rarely take a loan under extreme circumstances and also they have not subscribed for a term deposit.

housing=yes 2559 ==> y=no 2339    <conf:(0.91)> lift:(1.03) lev:(0.02) [74] conv:(1.33)
People who have taken the housing loan, do not tend to subscribe for a term deposit. 
This is genuine as the loan itself is a big thing in itself. 

default=no housing=yes 2514 ==> y=no 2297    <conf:(0.91)> lift:(1.03) lev:(0.02) [72] conv:(1.33)
This is a very positive rule. Firstly, the count of people with housing loan are very good on there installments and are thus not default in payments. 
This count is very high as compared to the total entries. 
Secondly, these people do not subscribe to term deposit, and thus are intelligent enough to not devulge into more issues.
